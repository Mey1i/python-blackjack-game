# Blackjack in Python ♠️♥️♣️♦️

A simple terminal-based Blackjack game written in Python.  
The project follows classic Blackjack rules: both the player and the computer receive two cards, can draw additional cards, and try to get as close as possible to 21 without going over.

## Features
- Random card dealing using Python’s `random` module  
- Automatic Ace adjustment (11 → 1 when needed)  
- Player decision system (“hit” or “stand”)  
- Dealer AI that draws cards until reaching at least 17  
- Clear result evaluation and winner detection  
- Fully playable in the terminal  

## How It Works
- Run the script.  
- You receive two cards and see one of the dealer's.  
- Choose whether to draw an additional card.  
- When you stop, the dealer draws automatically.  
- Final scores are compared and the winner is determined.
